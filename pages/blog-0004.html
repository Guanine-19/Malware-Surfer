                <h3>October 4, 2019</h3>
                
                <p>
                    Ah, its that time of the year again. No, not Christmas, you’re way ahead of yourself pal. It’s Halloween where people dress in whatever they want. Yes whatever they want, the spooky spirit of Halloween is gone because people just dress up as popular characters in games, anime, or movies nowadays. Enough with that let’s talk about what we need to talk about in this blog.   
                </p>

                <p>
                    This malware was inspired by the horror game, Mrs. Major where a doll follows you in a dark hallway and you solve puzzles and such in order to escape the wrath of Ms. Major. Although this malware is made for fun, it can still kill your operating system, which is not so very fun, don’t you think? So let’s jump right into it.    
                </p>

                <p>
                    The icon is a horned red demon, very scary. In case you’re having second thoughts on running this virus on your device, the creator of this malware added a warning dialogue before letting you run this program. Thank you so much for that, but I made up my mind and I give the virus my full consent to destroy this virtual machine (muwahahaha) for science!    
                </p>

                <img class="blog-pics" src=../img/0004-1.png>

                <p>
                    So after accepting everything and clicking install, you get this. You’re signing me out of my own account? Out of my own computer!? How dare you!? This is unacceptable. Just kidding, I did this to myself. Carrying on, you’ll be signed out and the system reboots.    
                </p>

                <img class="blog-pics" src=../img/0004-2.png>
                <p>
                    Upon the start-up of the system, we immediately see this, which would make a grown man scream if this virus was installed in his computer without him knowing. But I do not advise anyone to install this on their friend’s computer and just let it slide by saying “It’s just a prank, bro.” No, it’s not a prank to destroy someone else’s computer and erase their important files. It’s not even funny. Don’t do it.    
                </p>

                <img class="blog-pics" src=../img/0004-3.png>
                <p>
                    When the system is successfully done booting up, we see the virus in its full power. The desktop is filled with those red demon icons saying “HUMANS ARE TASTY” (depends on what type of human actually…). And there’s popups of creepy doll images randomly on the screen, which is actually Mrs. Major from the Mrs. Major game. It’s not a ransomware because my files are still safe, that worksheet folder and that phone advertisement picture (phew…) it’s just my system is trashed.    
                </p>
                <img class="blog-pics" src=../img/0004-4.png>
                <p>
                    Then a timer pops up explaining the rules of the malware’s game, the only thing is that there’s actually no way to win. So in less than three minutes, the system will shutdown and erase the Windows files necessary for the system to boot. The rules say that we can’t open task manager, and we can’t delete any of the virus files or the system will immediately bug down (Your PC will die). So what do we do in that three minutes? Can we still save our system? Sorry, unfortunately, we can’t. The only thing we can do is listen to the creepy music playing in the background and contemplate about our lives and wait for our computer to die.    
                </p>
                <img class="blog-pics" src=../img/0004-5.png>
                <P>
                    So after letting the timer run out, the system dies and we can no longer boot to Windows. The virus has deleted our system. So don’t do this as a prank.    
                </P>
                <img class="blog-pics" src=../img/0004-6.png>
                <P>
                    The funny story about this virus is that the creator strictly made disclaimers and warnings for people not to install this in their system unless they are using it to test anti-virus softwares or are running it on virtual machines. But there’s still some people who did and blamed the creator of this malware for having their files erased. So the creator made the malware unavailable to the public and would only let selected individuals access it (don’t ask me how I got it…). So you know I won’t be sharing any links to download this malware, cause it’s a malware.    
                </P>
                <P>
                    Happy Halloween, stay cybersecure.
                </P>
