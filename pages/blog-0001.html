                <p>
                    Let me just take this time to introduce my plans and my goals for this blog. I’ll also be taking this time to set up my virtual machines and stash some malware.
                </p>
                <img class="blog-pics" src=../img/0001-1.png>
                <p>
                    So I made this blog because to me, it is a big step to my cybersecurity career path. After finishing college (if I make it, lol) I’m planning to be a malware analyst or an ethical hacker. What drove me to consider this career? Just like anime, there’s also a backstory. So let me tell you about this one time, my sister actually got attacked by a ransomware. Her desktop was filled with Microsoft documents which turned out to be her encrypted files. Even her documents, her photos, her downloads, everything, all encrypted. My sister does digital art with her little computer and with no back up of her artworks and editable paint tool SAI files, I saw how frustrated she was losing her work. The ransom didn’t even bother to leave a note on how to recover her files, which was unusual for an attacker? Since the usual scenario is the ransom encrypts files and asks for an amount of bitcoins in exchange for a decryption key. But this one, they just threw a bomb and left the scene. No one knows what their motive was. Anyway back to my sister, she had to reinstall Windows and start from a blank canvas. Looking at a silver lining, at least she learned something from this. I hope she did.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s not just my sister who is a victim of these attacks. I’ve browsed through forums and social media, a lot of people actually have fell for these traps by these attackers. Sure, it’s easy money but not an ethical way to make a living. And I’m not trying to play the saint here, having the right to tell what’s right and wrong. I’m speaking not from my perspective, but from the view of the universe and it is a big No. These threats are comparable to theft and invasion of privacy. And these attackers are violating a lot of <a href="https://iclg.com/practice-areas/cybersecurity-laws-and-regulations/philippines" target="blank">cybersecurity laws.</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this blog, we’re gonna go through some malware, not any specific malware but any general form of malware. I’ll also take you to a history tour and we’ll see some of the deadliest malwares that cost companies billions of dollars in fixing and recovering from.
                </p>
                <h2>Plans for this Blog</h2>
                <p>
                    I’ll be covering all types of malware which are virus, worms, trojans, adwares, spywares, etc. and there might be even new forms as we progress. I’ll be updating this blog weekly. Aside from running malwares and killing virtual machines, I want to share some tips for ya’ll to stay cybersecure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wish to explain the virus reports on these malwares but I might need more experience to be actually able to interpret them. I might be in a later time, when I start my career in cybersecurity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, please note that I will not be sharing links to download these malware files. If you’re plotting a revenge and thinking of injecting a virus on your pal’s computer, that’s too far for a prank. Not cool, bro. Malwares are not a joke. Once the damage is done, there’s no recovering from it.
                </p>
                <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
                <p>
                    I am very cautious in running these malwares I had to run them on Ubuntu running virtual box because I value my files more than my life. I am not encouraging anyone to do this at home. The reason I am running these malwares in my device is so that you don’t need to do it yourself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Again, do not try this in your PC. Unless you know what you’re doing.
