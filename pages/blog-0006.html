                <p>
                    Imagine one day you were going through your mail, and you see one with the subject “I love you letter for you.” Out of curiosity and hope (hope it might be from someone you like?), you open it, see the attachment and download it. You double-click the text file, at least that’s what you think it is, and you just ran a script that killed not just your computer but also targeted your contacts that are potentially vulnerable to the attack. This attack is called the I Love You worm.
                </p>
                
                <div id="knowledge">
                    <img name="arrow" src="../img/bluearrow.png" style="min-height: 80px; max-height: 100px; float: left; bottom: 0;">
                    <p style="float: right; margin-left: 20px;">
                        ILOVEYOU, sometimes referred to as Love Bug or Love pak, is a computer worm that attacked tens of millions of Windows personal computers on and after 5 May 2000 local time in the Philippines when it started spreading as an email message with the subject line "ILOVEYOU" and the attachment "LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.txt.vbs". The latter file extension ('vbs', a type of interpreted file) was most often hidden by default on Windows computers of the time (as it is an extension for a file type that is known by Windows), leading unwitting users to think it was a normal text file. Opening the attachment activated the Visual Basic script. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILOVEYOU" target="blank">Click me</a> to read more information on the ILoveYou Worm and how it cost $10 billion worth of damages.

                <p>
                    During the 2000’s, Windows 95 was the commonly used variant of windows. In this system, file extensions were hidden. The love bug had the file name “LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT” which tricks the victim making them think its just a harmless text file and not a visual basic script that is capable of killing your system.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After running the deadly script, it seems like nothing happened because your files are still there. Shutdown the computer and when you boot it up, your system is gone. Just like that, nothing fancy or any graphical animated text, just a dead system that you can’t recover. This teaches us not to be a fool for love, lol.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The I love you worm was made by a Filipino student studying in AMA college. Although it is still unsure whether he is the creator of the virus but there are many leads linking to him. This legend’s name is Onel De Guzman, not praising him or crediting him in any way, just being ironically humorous. Onel was the average student in most of his subjects, having 3.0 or 2.5, just the average passing. But when it comes to computer subjects, he was a BEAST! He graded a flat 1.0 in Assembly Language! (dang!!!)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Onel's thesis was rejected by the professors in their university because of the questionable legality of it. They proposed a worm that is in the form of a script and it is capable of stealing passwords, the reason why it was rejected. It is unknown where Onel is now. Some say he was recruited by Anonymous, some say he now works for the NBI, and some say he's behind bars.
