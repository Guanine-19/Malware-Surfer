                <p>
                    Has your grandad ever taken you fishing when you were little? Me neither, the closest I did to fishing was playing pretend fishing as an imaginative little kid. And I think we all tried games where we’d reel a rod and try fishing digitally. For hackers, fishing, or ‘phishing’ as the method is called, is their type of game.    
                </p>
                
                <div id="knowledge">
                    <img name="arrow" src="../img/bluearrow.png" style="min-height: 80px; max-height: 100px; float: left;">
                    <p style="float: right; margin-left: 20px;">
                        Phishing is a form of fraud in which an attacker masquerades as a reputable entity or person in email or other communication channels. The attacker uses phishing emails to distribute malicious links or attachments that can perform a variety of functions, including the extraction of login credentials or account information from victims. <br /><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_security_software" target="blank">Read more</a>
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    These professional liars, or social engineers are very good in playing this game. So how it works, they send legit-looking e-mails asking for their victims to verify their account. When the victim falls for the trick or when the fish bites the bait, the attacker reels or steals their data. What can they do with that data? A lot actually, they can use the victims’ bank accounts to make online transactions, they can sell their information to interested persons and all such possibilities.    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let’s dive in the ocean and take a look at their traps. But let’s act as smart fishes and resist their bait.
                </p>
                <img class="blog-pics" src=../img/0003-1.png>
                <p>
                    Thanks for the warning Chrome, but I’m still going to proceed with the site. Thank you very much.     
                </p>
                <p>
                    First one, we have Microsoft’s Cloud service, OneDrive. This could be sent to you as an e-mail where in the attacker disguises their self as a co-worker/ classmate or a friend telling you you need to check this document, it’s really important and that’s why you click the link. And this is where it takes you. You need to log in to your OneDrive to open it.
                </p>
                <img class="blog-pics" src=../img/0003-2.png>
                <p>
                        See what happens when I try to log-in, it redirects me to Webmail, which I never heard of. Never and I say never fill out these forms. The site looks so generic in a way that it raises a brow. Doesn’t that look suspicious?
                </p>
                <img class="blog-pics" src=../img/0003-3.png>
                <p>
                    And when I select the option to log in with my Microsoft account, it leads me here.
                </p>
                <img class="blog-pics" src=../img/0003-4.png>
                <p>
                    See that “Please Login”. I find it funny because even Microsoft wouldn’t be that desperate to beg for you to log in to your One Drive. Plus, that footer on the bottom right is a little off.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let me actually try logging in. Note, these are not even registered e-mails.
                </p>
                <img class="blog-pics" src=../img/0003-5.png>
                <p>
                    And it redirects me to a failed authentication page from one of the legit pages from Microsoft.
                </p>
                <img class="blog-pics" src=../img/0003-6.png>
                <p>
                    So the user tries again, this time using the legit Microsoft One Drive Page and this time, they make a successful log in and might even forget about the failed log in attempt. But once they see there’s actually no document to view, that’s when they know, they messed up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a common type of phishing e-mail that targets office workers and students. We receive an e-mail from a co-worker or a classmate who is actually an attacker and they ask us to check an important document that is due in a few hours or the so-called classmate would say “Hey check the document attached for our report tomorrow.” and as a good co-worker or classmate, of course we’d check it out and then the consequence follows.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let’s be smart and cautious when we check our mails. We should verify first who sent the mail and we should check the links thoroughly. We should observe the website names if they are really the legitimate websites. Some attackers are brainy and change only one character of the website title or maintain the same title and use another top-level domain (.com/.org/.net). If you’re lucky, your browser security can spot the suspicious site before it even loads.
