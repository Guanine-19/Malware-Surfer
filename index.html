            <h2>Is this a Blog?</h2>
            <p>
                You might be wondering, ‘malware?’ what’s so interesting about malware that someone made a blog about it? Or you could even say that this site is for nerds only, and that the topic on viruses and threats is too much for you. I know you might be thinking that the topic is something of lesser interest so you feel like closing this tab. But wait!
                <br /><br />
                Let me spill a glass of enlightenment on your face. Starting with facts, because facts are always a good start to an argument, you like money right? who doesn’t. Well did you know that companies are suffering losses of up to a billion dollars because of a single malware? Yes, that’s how intense they are. Especially now that most of our lives revolve around technology, anyone who owns a computer or a smartphone is vulnerable to these threats.
                <br /><br />
                In this simple blog, we’re going to run some malware! Why? So I can teach you a thing or two about being cyber secure (TrendMicro must be proud). Yes, I’m going to use my own PC to run these deadly threats and I can show you first hand how they work to kill the Operating System.
                <br /><br />
                But you shouldn’t fret when you hear the word malware. Not all viruses can destroy your computer, some are just harmless and made to troll other people. We’ll be going through this later in this blog.
                <br /><br />
                So get you swimming shorts and sunblock, it's time to surf!

            <h2 style="color: white;">What’s a Malware?</h2>
            <p style="color: white;">
                The term "malware" — an amalgamation of malicious and software — is now used to describe any malicious program on a computer or mobile device. These programs are installed without the consent of users and can cause a number of unpleasant effects, such as crippling computer performance, mining your system for personal data, erasing data or even adversely affecting the operation of computer-controlled hardware. As hackers develop more sophisticated ways to infiltrate user systems, the malware market has exploded.

            <h2>Am I Infected?</h2>
            <p>
                How does your computer become infected by computer viruses or malware? There are several common ways. These include clicking on links to malicious sites in email messages or messages in social networks, visiting a compromised website (known as a drive-by download) and inserting an infected USB flash drive in your computer. Operating system and application vulnerabilities make it easy for cybercriminals to install malware on computers. So it's vital that you apply security updates as soon as they become available to reduce your exposure to risk.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cybercriminals often make use of social engineering to trick you into doing something that jeopardizes your security or the security of the company you work for. Phishing emails are one of the most common methods. You receive an email that looks legitimate and convinces you to download an infected file or visit a malicious website. Here, the goal of hackers is to create something you find convincing, such as a supposed virus warning, notification from your bank or message from an old friend.
            </p>
            <p>
                Confidential data, such as passwords, are a key target of cybercriminals. As well as using malware to capture passwords as they are typed, cybercriminals also collect passwords from websites and other computers they have been able to hack. That's why it's so important that you use a unique, complex password for each online account. This means 15 characters or more, made up of letters, numbers and special characters. This way, if one account is compromised, cybercriminals don't get access to all your online accounts. Of course, if you use easy-to-guess passwords, cybercriminals may not need to compromise your machine or the website of an online provider. Unfortunately, most users have woefully weak passwords. Instead of using strong, hard-to-guess passwords, they rely on standbys, like "123456" or "Password123," which are easy for attackers to guess. Even security questions may not act as an effective barrier, because many people give the same answer: If the question is "What's your favorite food?" and you're in the United States, "Pizza" is a common answer.
